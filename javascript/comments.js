// 1. Single - line Comment
// Use // to write a single-line comment.

// This is a single-line comment
// let x = 10; // This is also a single-line comment


// 2. Multi - line Comment
// Use /* */ to write multi - line comments

/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span multiple lines.
*/
// let y = 20;


// Best Practices
// * Use comments to explain why, not what.
// * Don't over-comment obvious code.
// * Use comments to disable lines temporarily during debugging:
    // let result = complexFunction(); // Disabled for now
